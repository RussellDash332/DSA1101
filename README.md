# Welcome to DSA1101!
This repository provides some of my self-made resources to DSA1101. Feel free to fork or share to others, hope it helps 😊

### Notes
+ The main R file is at [DSA1101.r](https://github.com/RussellDash332/DSA1101/blob/main/DSA1101.r).
+ Unless you need to test only some parts of the code, I have separated it in the [Topics](https://github.com/RussellDash332/DSA1101/tree/main/Topics) section including the necessary [datasets](https://github.com/RussellDash332/DSA1101/tree/main/Topics/Datasets). Feel free to use or modify the code if needed.
+ Finally, I've also included my own solution to the available [PYPs](https://github.com/RussellDash332/DSA1101/tree/main/PYPs). They are **unofficial** solutions, so please do not take it for granted.

That's all for now. Peace out 🍀
> NB: Feel free to tell me if there's something wrong with the code/file. I will try to fix it if I have free time.
